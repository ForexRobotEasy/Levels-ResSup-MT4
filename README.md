# Levels ResSup MT4

Levels ResSup MT4 is a trading tool developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to optimize forex trades using advanced indicators. This code provides functions to construct support and resistance lines on price charts, indicate support and resistance levels, form additional support levels, disable additional support levels, determine internal support and resistance levels, distinguish internal support and resistance levels, move the StartTL line along the history, and redraw support and resistance lines.

## How it works

The code is written in MQL4 and can be used in the MetaTrader 4 platform. It is intended to be used as part of an expert advisor or custom indicator.

The `ConstructSupportResistanceLines` function is responsible for creating support and resistance lines on the price chart. The implementation logic for this function should be added within the function body.

The `IndicateSupportResistanceLevels` function is used to indicate support levels in blue and resistance levels in red. Again, the specific implementation logic for this function should be added within the function body.

The `FormAdditionalSupportLevels` function is used to form additional support levels marked by the same colors in strokes.

The `DisableAdditionalSupportLevels` function is responsible for disabling the additional support levels if needed.

The `DetermineInternalSupportResistanceLevels` function is used to determine internal support and resistance levels.

The `DistinguishInternalSupportResistanceLevels` function is responsible for distinguishing internal support levels by green markings and internal resistance levels by pink markings.

The `MoveStartTLLine` function is used to move the orange vertical StartTL line along the history.

The `RedrawSupportResistanceLines` function is responsible for automatically redrawing support and resistance lines according to the new position of the StartTL line.

The `OnInit` function is the entry point of the program. It calls the necessary functions to construct and indicate support and resistance lines, form and disable additional support levels, determine and distinguish internal support and resistance levels, move the StartTL line, and redraw support and resistance lines.

The `OnDeinit` function is called when the program is deinitialized. Any necessary cleanup operations can be performed within this function.

The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the price data. This is where trading operations can be performed.

## Product Description

Levels ResSup MT4 is a powerful trading tool that optimizes forex trades with advanced indicators. Developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, this tool automates the process of constructing support and resistance lines, indicating support and resistance levels, forming additional support levels, disabling additional support levels, determining internal support and resistance levels, distinguishing internal support and resistance levels, moving the StartTL line, and redrawing support and resistance lines.

By utilizing the functions provided in the code, traders can save time and effort in manually identifying and marking support and resistance levels. The tool accurately identifies these levels and indicates them on the price chart, making it easier for traders to make informed trading decisions.

Additionally, Levels ResSup MT4 goes beyond the basic support and resistance levels by determining internal support and resistance levels. These levels are distinguished from the external ones, providing traders with a more comprehensive view of the market dynamics.

With the ability to automatically redraw support and resistance lines based on the movement of the StartTL line, Levels ResSup MT4 ensures that traders always have up-to-date levels to guide their trading strategies.
